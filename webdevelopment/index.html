    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our Algebra 2 learning space, where exponential equations become approachable and even understandable. This page will guide you step-by-step as you build confidence with one of the most powerful topics in mathematics solving equations.</p>

   <blockquote>“Small steps lead to big growth — just like exponential functions.”</blockquote>

   <p>Solving exponential equations is a key skill in Algebra 2 and an essential part of understanding how quantities grow and change in the real world. These equations appear in situations involving population growth, radioactive decay, compound interest, and many other natural and financial processes. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to recognize exponential equations by identifying growth and decay, and rewrite expressions using common bases to solve equations that can’t be simplified by inspection. You’ll also explore strategies for isolating exponential expressions and avoiding common mistakes students often make. By the end, you’ll have a strong foundation for solving exponential equations with confidence and accuracy.  These skills will support you in advanced math courses and real-life applications.</p>
