    <h1>About</h1>
    <h3>Educator credentials</h3>
    <p>Hello my name is Brian Kaestner.  I am working towards my masters degree at the University of Missouri.  I am studying Learning Technology and Design with an emphasis in school.  I plan to graduate in December 2026.  I have my undergraduate from Lindenwood University in mathematics education.  I am currently a high school math teacher but have also taught middle school in the past.  Some of my hobbies include camping at different parks such as; The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Banff, Jasper, Glacier, Bryce Canyon, and Zion to name a few.  I am also interested in pc gaming and woodworking. Most of my woodworking experience is from working on different projects around my house.  My wife and I have two kids now, a three year old boy and a one year old baby girl.  The two kids now take up most of my time and money. </p>
